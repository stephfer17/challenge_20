The purpose of the analysis was to create a Supervised Learning program that can help determine if an applicant will be a high loan risk or not. 
This is important to banks , as it can speed up process of giving out loans towards their customers and knowing how much money to give out for those loans.
From the data collected there were 75036 that had good credit scores and 2500 that did not. Using the loan status column to determine if its a safe to lend a loan out to that customer.
After spilting the data into test and trainning data than making a liner regression. The results showed a 99% accuary towards the machine learning.
It was done again by Randomizing the data and it still came with a 99% accaury towards determing if the customer is a high risk or not.

## Results
For the first test
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       1.00      0.99      1.00     18765
           1       0.85      0.91      0.88       619

    accuracy                           0.99     19384
   macro avg       0.92      0.95      0.94     19384
weighted avg       0.99      0.99      0.99     19384

For the second test
 precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       1.00      0.99      1.00     18765
           1       0.84      0.99      0.91       619

    accuracy                           0.99     19384
   macro avg       0.92      0.99      0.95     19384
weighted avg       0.99      0.99      0.99     19384
Cleary the model that was used on the data was a really strong indicator if a customer is a high risk when comes giving out loans
